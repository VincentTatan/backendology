# Top 10 Books for New Software Engineers

I'm excited to share my top ten list of books new Software Engineers should invest in reading! Some of these books have proved foundational in helping me transition from student to developer and deepen my skills.

First, a disclaimer: there are some great books missing from this list because I haven't read them yet. I want this list to be as authentic as possible and therefore I will not recommend a book until I've read it cover to cover. If you have read an impressive book that you think deserves a spot on this list, comment and I will check it out!

## Top Ten

### 10. [The Master Algorithm](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465094279/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0465094279&linkCode=as2&tag=jaredririeblo-20&linkId=b298988a7eb225433e4447285d456a84)

High-level introduction to various methods and areas within Machine Learning.

Google loves machine learning. Becoming less of a niche and more of a general requirement for software engineers.

### 9. [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020161622X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=020161622X&linkCode=as2&tag=jaredririeblo-20&linkId=8a65d8f4a0151dade8e2a2f3294909c3)

A bit dated in parts, but its core offerings make it a worthwhile read.

One example from the book that has stayed with me is the analogy of the woodworker.
For woodworkers, the primary material of their work is wood and as such, they become intimately familiar with wood and the tools used to manipulate wood. The correlating material for a developer is text. Some of our tools include editors, IDEs, and terminals. Just like the woodworker, we need to become intimately familiar with text and tools that manipulate text. It’s pragmatic to learn keyboard shortcuts and automations. It’s wise to try many editors and terminals and know the software backwards and forwards. It surprises me how many programmers don’t know simple shortcuts like alt + left/right arrow to move the cursor in increments of words rather than characters! Common editor features like multi-cursor select elude many, yet I don’t know what I would do without it—I find at least one application of this feature every day. It has uses for many things outside of renaming a variable in code.

### 8. Eloquent JavaScript ([Print](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593279507/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1593279507&linkCode=as2&tag=jaredririeblo-20&linkId=067d30460a755446e9ce867a129f1bc2), [Free Online Version](http://eloquentjavascript.net/))

Taught me much more than JavaScript.

3rd edition recently came out

Depth-first vs. breadth-first search in robot path finding project was extremely thought-provoking.

### 7. [Go In Practice](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1633430073/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1633430073&linkCode=as2&tag=jaredririeblo-20&linkId=52b8b21a37be43441f712179120814d0)

While the space for books about the Go programming language is growing, it's particularly thin when it comes to books geared towards intermediate to advanced developers. Go In Practice is for an intermediate audience and it did a decent job of exposing me to some new techniques that I was not familiar with.

(New concepts it taught me, like about goroutines)

My overall recommendation is to look elsewhere for resources to learn Go, but if you are set on a book, I think this is a solid choice.

### 6. [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0984782850/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0984782850&linkCode=as2&tag=jaredririeblo-20&linkId=e859b809e508c63a05119e619a7893e5)

Honorable mention: Grokking Algorithms

The coding interview, whether you agree with it or not, is the defacto way to interview candidates. While not all skills that are required to be good at interviews overlap with skills necessary for the job, there’s enough overlap to keep this practice going.

Take time to get good at coding interviews. This book is a great way to do just that. Haven’t technically finished as I practice 10-20 interview questions each quarter. This has helped me develop my algorithm and data structure skills. With a Computer Engineering degree, I never took some advanced CS classes like algorithms, so I had a lot of catching up to do in this space.

### 5. [The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0999081411/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0999081411&linkCode=as2&tag=jaredririeblo-20&linkId=72ce4355157a164d499ed8f8aca50486)

Jon Sonmez (check) is an example of a software engineer who has made an impressive impact in the field and as a result done well financially. He focuses on teaching software developers how to have a successful career (landing the best-possible job, getting promoted, learning, picking a specialty, writing a blog). I found his advice very motivating and have applied several of his ideas with success.

The book is quite lengthy, but I found it to be an easy read filled with great content that made me genuinely excited to keep ready.

### 4. [Building Microservices](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491950358/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1491950358&linkCode=as2&tag=jaredririeblo-20&linkId=ff6627ecc170adf678c48add7232c76a)

Building Microservices is the book that helped me make sense of the wonderful and horrific world of microservices. It was immediately applicable to the projects I was working on at work, so I feel like I came away with a deep understanding of its concepts. I would learn about a concept like circuit breaking one day and implement it the next, which made for an enriching learning experience.

(Concepts it covers, best chapters)

### 3. [Clean Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134494164/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0134494164&linkCode=as2&tag=jaredririeblo-20&linkId=f5aa6b16f1d067615e5f4add5291e7d9)

Changed the way I thought about the code I write. Helped me to structure my code such that the business logic is in the “inner” portion of the architecture, decoupled from the “outer” portion which handles transforming data to/from external sources. A concrete example of this is that the core logic of your service should not need to change if you change the input from HTTP to a command-line interface.

Opinionated at times, but the opinions are substantiated

### 2. [NoSQL Distilled](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321826620/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321826620&linkCode=as2&tag=jaredririeblo-20&linkId=ad0c449b8cb5df43051f62f0de3e12e4)

If you work with NoSQL databases or are considering doing so, I consider this book a must-read. It's quite compact (just over 150 pages) yet efficiently teaches critical database concepts to understand NoSQL. The material of this book helped me operate a NoSQL database called Couchbase and understand the implications of its failure scenarios.

I actually read this book twice, first just as I started my career as a Software Engineer and then again two years later once I had a better understanding of databases. To be honest, I didn't understand it very well the first time as *everything* was new. Reading technical books multiple times can be extremely useful as it often takes additional experience to grasp difficult concepts.

### 1. [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449373321/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1449373321&linkCode=as2&tag=jaredririeblo-20&linkId=6ae4fe247a516730f1e0677905f65987)

This book is *phenomenal* and can stand confidently in the number one position in this list! I strongly believe that all software engineers should make their way through this book! It's on the lengthier side with sometimes dense and advanced content, but it's well written and incredibly relevant to software systems today.

If you're an experienced developer, you may think the book is too introductory from the first two chapters. Keep reading and you'll find rigorous explanations of concepts within distributed and database systems that will give you depth in these areas.

## Current reading list

I keep an updated and prioritized list of books I would like to read. Here are some of the software-focused books on that list:
