# Yet Another Software Blog

Welcome! This is the first post of my blog. If you’re reading this, you’re either arriving right on the ground floor or somehow I kept up with my goal to have an updated blog and you're reading an older post. Either way, I’ll consider you a *founder*. I hope that you can find value in the blog posts I have planned.

## Why does the world need another software-focused blog?

While it's true that we already have plenty of popular software blogs out there, like [Martin Fowler’s](https://martinfowler.com/) or [Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/), I recently convinced myself that ***every* software engineer should have a blog.**

Yes, we all need blogs, or at least some way to consistently distill what we’re learning down to a consumable format like a blog. Something incredible happens when we teach what we have learned to others: *it sticks* (not necessarily with the learner, but with the teacher)! The most successful software engineers are not only constantly learning, they are teaching and mentoring others.

The goal I have in mind for this blog is to motivate myself to continue actively learning and compose my thoughts such that I'm able to clearly communicate new things I learn.

## A little about me

My name is Jared Ririe. I currently work as a Software Engineer at a great company, Qualtrics. It’s an engaging place to work and I get to tackle some genuinely interesting problems. It’s also small enough that I’ve been able to make a big impact despite being early in my career. The various projects I’ve worked on have taught me a lot about backend technologies, microservices, and distributed systems. I’m fortunate to work in this area as I’m truly passionate about it.

I graduated from Brigham Young University with a B.S. in Computer Engineering back in April 2016. Why CE and not CS? I wanted to understand how computers worked. I love low-level details and breaking down abstractions. I did always lean toward the software side of CE, however, and a part-time position at Qualtrics convinced me that software, not hardware, was my path forward.

# Notes (supplementary to blog post)

* Why blogging helps software engineers
    - Writing teaches you to organize your thoughts clearly in a way that other people can understand.
    - The more you write, the better of a communicator you’ll become in general.
    - I don’t think there is any better way to improve your communication skills than writing.
    - Blogging also helps you keep track of your own career and progress, as well as provides some historical documentation and reference material which you can look back on to see how you solved a particular problem in the past.
    - Every software developer should have their own blog
* Tips for new bloggers
    - When you are first starting out, no one wants to know about your personal life and what you did today.
    - If you want to be a successful blogger, the most important thing you can do is be consistent.
    - Create a few ultimate guides or posts that you consider the best resource on whatever topic you are writing about.
