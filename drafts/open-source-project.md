## Projects

### Moby (Docker)

https://github.com/moby/moby

> Docker is a containerization platform. It is a way to enable developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications and microservices by standardizing
environments and eliminating inconsistencies and busywork.

"Project Moby is the new upstream for the Docker project," Messina said, using Git terminology for the source code repository from which a project is cloned.

### [Exercism](https://github.com/exercism/exercism)

> Exercism is a platform where experienced and aspiring programmers can quickly ramp up their fluency in the basics of a new programming language. The project supports over 30 languages, with support for new languages added on a regular basis.
>
> The easiest place to begin contributing to Exercism is the curriculum, since each programming language has its own stand-alone repository, and each exercise is isolated from the others.[^1]

### [InfluxDB](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb)

> This is the repository for InfluxDB 2.0 OSS, which includes components previously known as Chronograf and Kapacitor.[^2]
