# My Experience Using Hugo

This blog post is off topic in that it focuses on blogging more than backend software development. That said, I think you will enjoy this post if you have any interest in blogging, static site generation, or Go.

Hugo is one of the solutions I am proving out for creating my blog.

## What is Hugo?

### Wordpress

Wordpress is a fully-featured and proven website creation platform. It has everything you need to write a blog, including plenty of free themes, plugins to share your new posts via social media providers (and automatically send an email-version of your post to those who subscribe), and subtle yet usable Markdown support.

It's worth noting here that [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/) is different from [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/). wordpress.com is a solution built on top of the open source software which is Wordpress (wordpress.org). wordpress.com offers things like free and paid hosting options and a simpler GUI for writing posts.

When I first started writing this blog, I chose to host my site under a free wordpress.com subdomain--this removed the barrier to start blogging in terms of both effort and cost. I was still settling on a name for my blog anyway, so I didn't want to pay for a domain quite yet. If I chose Wordpress going foward, I will use the open source version directly and buy my own domain.

Wordpress has some clear disadvantages in my mind. Foremost, its target audience is not a software engineer who thinks some of the challenges of blogging might be fun to solve as a form of side project. Because it's so fully featured, there aren't that many problems left to solve. I think someone who doesn't write software might find it strange I'm listing this as a negative! Perhaps fellow developers will agree that it would be fun to learn how to integrate with a commenting system or learn the Twitter API well enough to update folowers of new posts. Even as I write this, though, I am starting to see that needing to solve these problems will just slow me

### Jekyll

Jekyll is more directly comparable to Hugo as it's primarily a static site generator, not a full blogging solution.

Let's follow a post from draft to finished product to learn more how one might use Hugo to statically generate a blog.
