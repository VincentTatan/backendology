# Designing a Comprehensive Course in Distributed Systems: Introductory Course

In my [previous blog post](https://backendology.com/2018/09/10/distributed-systems-course-reading-list/), I created a detailed reading list of the distributed systems content I deemed most important and interesting. This post is the next step towards designing a comprehensive course in distributed systems: creating an introductory course.

Why not simply start at the top of the reading list and work down? I think any good introduction to this topic should provide a sampling of the various concepts and encourage experimentation and hands on learning. I also organized my reading list such that the "Distributed systems in the wild" section is almost last. I believe that failing to cover some real systems in an introductory course is a lost opportunity. Students and practitioners often have experience interacting with the user-facing parts of systems like Kafka, Memcache, or Cassandra. Satisfying the curiosity to learn how these systems work under the hood can fuel the harder parts of learning distributed systems, such as grappling with Paxos.

Speaking of Paxos, it was designed first but the newcomer Raft is intended to be much easier to learn and implement. For this reason, I think an introductory course doesn't need to dive into the details of Paxos. A high-level understanding may prove useful.

Without further ado, here is my course, _Introduction to Distributed Systems_:
