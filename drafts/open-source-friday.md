## Finding a project

> Start by thinking about the projects you already use, or want to use. The projects youâ€™ll actively contribute to are the ones you find yourself coming back to.
>
> Within those projects, whenever you catch yourself thinking that something could be better or different, act on your instinct.[^1]

### ["Great for new contributors"](https://github.com/showcases/great-for-new-contributors)
